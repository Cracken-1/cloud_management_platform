### 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (production-ready)
- **Security**: Row Level Security, JWT tokens, HTTPS

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Supabase account and project
- Vercel account (for deployment)

### 1. Clone and Install
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd cloud-management-platform
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Fill in your Supabase credentials and security code
```

### 3. Database Setup
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Run the SQL from `src/lib/database/comprehensive-schema.sql`
3. Configure authentication settings

### 4. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
vercel --prod
```

### 5. Create First Superadmin
1. Navigate to `/superadmin/register`
2. Use your security code to create the first superadmin
3. Verify email and access the dashboard

## 🔐 Superadmin Access Control

### Authorized Superadmin Emails
For security, superadmin access is restricted to pre-authorized email addresses. To add authorized emails:

1. Edit `src/lib/auth/superadmin-access.ts`
2. Add email addresses to the `AUTHORIZED_SUPERADMIN_EMAILS` array
3. In production, consider using environment variables for this list

### Authentication Flow Fixes
- ✅ **Google OAuth redirect fixed**: Now properly redirects to `/admin` or `/superadmin/dashboard` based on user role
- ✅ **Superadmin access restriction**: Only authorized emails can access superadmin login
- ✅ **Role-based redirects**: Users are automatically redirected to appropriate dashboards
- ✅ **Unauthorized access prevention**: Regular users cannot access superadmin portal

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key

# Security
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPERADMIN_CODE=YourSecureCode2024!

# Application
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=InfinityStack Enterprise Platform
```

### Supabase Setup
1. **Authentication Settings**:
   - Enable email confirmations
   - Set site URL and redirect URLs
   - Configure email templates

2. **Database**:
   - Apply the comprehensive schema
   - Verify RLS policies are active
   - Set up proper indexing

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-factor security** with email verification
